# Agent Knowledge

A centralized, file-based knowledge-management system for coding agents running
across multiple machines.

The intended source of truth is a hierarchy of Markdown documents and ordinary
attachment files. Client machines submit and retrieve information through a
restricted gateway; they do not synchronize the repository with Git.

## Status

The initial architecture is defined and implementation has not started.

- Rust is the implementation language.
- OpenSSH forced commands provide the client transport and authentication
  boundary.
- A durable file queue separates request acceptance from repository changes.
- A single Repository Worker applies atomic changes, commits them with Git, and
  publishes static releases with Quartz.
- A conventional Linux host is the initial target. The design remains
  compatible with a future single-replica Kubernetes deployment.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the complete architecture, invariants,
protocol, persistence, recovery, and delivery plan.

## Development

Enter the pinned development environment:

```sh
direnv allow
```

Initialize the local Git hooks and run the repository checks:

```sh
just init
just check
```
